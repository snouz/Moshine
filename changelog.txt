    - info.json improve for humain reading
    - add fr loc
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-02-20
  Content:
    - Added AI trainer, model training mechanic (gambling to improve models until they higher tiers, slot them into the neural computer)
    - Hard drives become "datacells", added recipes to load and unload data in them
    - Added glass, glass tech
    - Tech tree reorganized
  Changes:
    - (planet) Made the planet locked behind electromagnetic plant
    - (planet) Made steam 500Â°C (instead of 175)
    - (planet) Doubled Neodymium probability
    - (planet) Made foundations buildable on iron lava pools
    - Heating sand gives glass instead of silicon (like aai-industry)
    - Silicon is made in chem plants using additional coal and steam
    - Changed some names and descriptions (3D-data-storage -> holographic core, supercomputer -> Neural computer, raw data -> training data... )
    - Quantum-processor-productivity research 3.5* more expensive, and 100* slower (forces you to use AI cores as modules)
    - Computers can use training data for research, added as ingredients
    - Made magnets cheaper (5 -> 1 Neodymium)
    - Made hard-drives/datacells cheaper (5 -> 1 Magnets, 5 -> 1 Advanced-circuits)
    - Optical fiber require glass
    - Holographic core require glass, cheaper otherwise
    - Made unstable models explosions ~5x more damaging
  Graphics:
    - (planet) Improved starmap icon (thanks to DjKolekson's contribution)
  Bugfixes:
    - Silicon isn't reasearch on planet discovery anymore
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2025-02-19
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed removal of placed optical fibers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2025-02-19
  Changes:
    - (planet) Modified mixed-ores ratios (Neodymium*5, sand-, sulfur-, coal+, copper+)
    - (planet) Petroleum custom recipe changed (coal required instead of carbon, and outputs carbon instad of coal)
    - (planet) Prevented nuclear/fusion reactors from being built on the planet
    - Made optical fiber length (almost) infinite
    - Disallow productivity modules in supercomputers
  Compatibility:
    - Added compatibility with Silica & Silicon (thanks to Dh4mpyr)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2025-02-11
  Compatibility:
    - Added compatibility with mods that add ingredients to ALL techs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-02-11
  Changes:
    - Added Quantum-processor productivity infinite research (gives a reward at the end of the planet, makes the experience complete until more content is made in the future)
    - Made supercomputer display after biolab in reseach
    - Forced update of Moshine-assets (fixed recycling coal would give sand/sulfur/carbon, Molten-iron lava more blue, mixed ore non-infinite)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 2025-02-09
  Changes:
    - (Thank you to all the players who joined the beta and gave feedback)
    - (planet) Removed the ability to build accumulators on the planet
    - (planet) Dramatically reduced the yield of mixed ore patches
    - (planet) 10x less neodymium dropped (drop 273 at once but very rarely)
    - (planet) Added a recipe for Petroleum (using sand, carbon, sulfur and steam)
    - Supercomputer sound changed to lab (instead of biolab)
    - Supercomputer won't add science packs added by other mods when they add it to all labs
    - Reduced crafting time for models (red/white cubes)
    - Reduced health and data quantity on optical fiber
    - Changed unstable model to 10s and stable to 40s
    - Unstable model costs only 3D storage, but 3D storage costs 30 magnets
    - Lowered luminosity a bit, except at noon
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed unstable models never actually spawning
    - Fixed Supercomputer's funky collision/selection box (made it 6x6 square)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 2025-02-07
  Changes:
    - (planet) Fixes
    - Added Silicon carbide to the Data processor recipe
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when researching with hard drive or model in Supercomputer
    - (planet) Fixed compatibility with AAI Industries (made silicon a normal crafting recipe in that case only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
