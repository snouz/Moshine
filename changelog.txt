Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-03-..
  Info:
    - /!\ This update changes some recipes, so you'll have to adapt your existing setups /!\
  Content:
    - Added the AI trainer, and model training mechanic (gambling to improve models until they higher tiers, slot them into the neural computer)
    - Added the Indexer and Webbed processors (a process farm for equations)
    - Hard drives become "datacells", added recipes to load and unload data in them
    - Added long-handed inserters as a reward
    - Added glass, glass tech
    - Tech tree reorganized
    - Added space platform ground tiles
    - Added minimalist rails (costs neodymium and silicon carbide)
  Locale:
    - French translation by Fr_Dae
  Changes:
    - (planet) Made the planet locked behind electromagnetic plant
    - (planet) Made steam 500°C (instead of 175)
    - (planet) Doubled Neodymium probability
    - (planet) Made foundations buildable on iron lava pools
    - Heating sand gives glass instead of silicon (like aai-industry)
    - Silicon is made in chem plants using additional coal and steam, made faster
    - Changed some names and descriptions (3D-data-storage -> holographic core, supercomputer -> Neural computer, raw data -> training data... )
    - Quantum-processor-productivity research 3.5* more expensive, and 100* slower (forces you to use AI cores as modules)
    - Computers can use training data for research, added as ingredients
    - Neural computer and data processor can use AI cores to speed up research/production
    - Made magnets cheaper (5 -> 1 Neodymium)
    - Silicon cell cheaper (10 -> 5 Silicon)
    - Made hard-drives/datacells cheaper (5 -> 1 Magnets, 5 -> 1 Advanced-circuits)
    - Optical fiber require glass
    - Holographic core require glass, cheaper otherwise
    - Made unstable models explosions ~5x more damaging
  Graphics:
    - (planet) Improved starmap icon (thanks to DjKolekson's contribution)
    - Reworked some tech icons
    - Neural computer: added animation graphics
  Sounds:
    - Neural computer custom sound
    - Data extractor custom sound
    - Data processor custom sound
  Bugfixes:
    - Silicon isn't reasearch on planet discovery anymore
    - Fixed compatibility with Omnicompression
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2025-02-19
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed removal of placed optical fibers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2025-02-19
  Changes:
    - (planet) Modified mixed-ores ratios (Neodymium*5, sand-, sulfur-, coal+, copper+)
    - (planet) Petroleum custom recipe changed (coal required instead of carbon, and outputs carbon instad of coal)
    - (planet) Prevented nuclear/fusion reactors from being built on the planet
    - Made optical fiber length (almost) infinite
    - Disallow productivity modules in supercomputers
  Compatibility:
    - Added compatibility with Silica & Silicon (thanks to Dh4mpyr)

Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2025-02-11
  Compatibility:
    - Added compatibility with mods that add ingredients to ALL techs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-02-11
  Changes:
    - Added Quantum-processor productivity infinite research (gives a reward at the end of the planet, makes the experience complete until more content is made in the future)
    - Made supercomputer display after biolab in reseach
    - Forced update of Moshine-assets (fixed recycling coal would give sand/sulfur/carbon, Molten-iron lava more blue, mixed ore non-infinite)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 2025-02-09
  Changes:
    - (Thank you to all the players who joined the beta and gave feedback)
    - (planet) Removed the ability to build accumulators on the planet
    - (planet) Dramatically reduced the yield of mixed ore patches
    - (planet) 10x less neodymium dropped (drop 273 at once but very rarely)
    - (planet) Added a recipe for Petroleum (using sand, carbon, sulfur and steam)
    - Supercomputer sound changed to lab (instead of biolab)
    - Supercomputer won't add science packs added by other mods when they add it to all labs
    - Reduced crafting time for models (red/white cubes)
    - Reduced health and data quantity on optical fiber
    - Changed unstable model to 10s and stable to 40s
    - Unstable model costs only 3D storage, but 3D storage costs 30 magnets
    - Lowered luminosity a bit, except at noon
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed unstable models never actually spawning
    - Fixed Supercomputer's funky collision/selection box (made it 6x6 square)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
